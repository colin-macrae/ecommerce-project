# Pinocelli Cycling Apparel
A full stack ecommerce web application for cyclists, for the purchase of premium cycling apparel

This project was done for educational purposes, to incorporate the knowledge I (Colin) had accumulated over the prevous weeks.

I chose this specific project for the following reasons:
- I could build my first full-stack project
- I could more easily envision the project, compared to other ideas, from beginning to end, which gave me more confidence as I planned and built it
- I have a passion for cycling
- I knew I could make something aesthetically pleasing with images I found during ideation
- People could easily understand it
